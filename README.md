## Property Binding

### Property Binding

- It is use to change property and attributes in html it also works with boolean values.

in `app` component disable false is not working as `false` in interpolation false count as a string and it show behavior of `true`

### interpolation

- Using this is not a good practice for attribute and property in html and also it is only works with numbers and string
